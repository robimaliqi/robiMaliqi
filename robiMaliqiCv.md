Having worked in the haulage industry, I decided to make a career change. I wanted to be in a field where I am constantly challenging myself and learning new things. So here I am.

I thrive on new challenges and highly motivated to achieve the very best in all that I do. I enjoy working with a wide range of technologies and pushing myself to maximise my potential. I am skilled in effectively contributing to a team, pair programming and working independently whilst using version control software. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to gain valuable knowledge/insights/experience and use my proven skills in an agile team.

## Skills

<p align="justify">

**_Discipline & Growth_**

I thrive throwing myself in the deep and outside of my comfort zone, I belive that is where I grow the most. I have shown this by opening a company in a industry I did not have much knowledge or expertise in. I put myself in a position where I had to pick things up quickly and learn on the job. I am able to take this experience with me any where and apply it to any industry.

**_Communication_**

I always make communication my priority whether it is in my personal life or the workplace. Lack of communication is one of the biggest causes of problems and conflicts. Asking a lot of questions and communication come hand in hand and I try to ask as many questions as I can, so I can have as much understanding of things as possible. I like to break things down in the simplest form and dive deep into the understanding of concepts, the best way to learn something is to be able to teach it to someone else, therefore when I learn something I always like to see if I can regurgitate back to someone else. This helps me make sure my communication skills are up to scratch.

**_Leadership_ + Teamwork**

During my time at my previous role, I was responsible for leading a team of drivers and looking after 3 lorries. The company was growing fast and so I had to move fast to supply the increase in demand so I was regularly recruiting drivers and looking to purchase more lorries. It was not easy at the beginning and I had to go through a lot of pain and struggle, I was once a driver myself as I did not have enough money to pay drivers so I knew what daily struggles my drivers were going through, I think this is essential to being a great leader and understanding people's concerns. During the Makers Bootcamp, I was the leader of a group project where I made sure the stand-ups and retros ran on time and smoothly, people who had any concerns were seen and the issues were dealt with. Using Agile philosophy, we made the projects fun, challenging and incredibly rewarding ensuring the workload was spread evenly amongst the team members.

## Hobbies üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Chess:
  I love to keep my brain active by problem-solving and competing against other chess players playing online against them.
- Camping & Hiking:
  I enjoy the outdoors and chasing sunrises/sunsets, so I go camping and hiking often. I like to plan a hiking adventure with friends or family where we camp and wake up early to hike up a mountain and catch the sunrise. Also, it's nice to switch off and have no technology.
- Reading:
  I am a bit of a bookworm and love reading in my spare time. Sometimes I get hooked on a book and can't put it down.
- Travelling:
  I love travelling, visiting new places, and learning about history and culture. Even though I have not seen a lot of places so far, I have a long list of places I plan to visit, mainly in south-east Asia and central + South America.
